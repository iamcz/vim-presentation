# ETC

- `:help` provides an interactive manual page for learning anything and everything vim
- vimtutor is a program that interactively teaches you the basics of vim (preinstalled alongside vim
  IIRC)
- By default vim doesn't come with much in the way of tools commonly used in many GUI editors. Janus
  is a vim distribution that comes with many plugins that are used for day to day tasks. It is worth
  looking at but IMO it offers too much but serves as a good reference for plugins that you can
  install when you realize you need them

- vim golf (http://www.vimgolf.com/)
