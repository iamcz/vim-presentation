# Configuration
- vim is highly configurble through the .vimrc file (you may have a global vimrc and project
  specific vimrc which will override any global settings)
- Vim is highly customizeable with plugins like many other text editors Two popular plugin managers
  are Vundle and Pathogen (I use Vundle and I think it is more widely used)
- Quick walkthrough of my vimrc `:e $MYVIMRC`
