# Files

# Buffers
- vim opens files in buffers where changes can be made without saving
- if you ls a directory you're working in you will see .swp or .swo files
- if you enter a new file from a working buffer you can navigate into and out of it with <C-i> and
  <C-o>

# Windows
- vim has builtin support for windows
- windows are splits that allow you to view multiple files on the same screen
- `:split`, `:vsplit`, <C-w>hjkl

# Tabs
- You already know what a tab is
- Commands: `:tabnew`, `:tabn`, `:tabp`
