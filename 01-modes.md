# Modes

## Normal Mode
- Upon loading vim you are automatically in normal mode
- normal mode is useful for navigation
- the motivation of normal mode is that the majority of the time is not spent writing code but
  rather reading it

## Visual Mode
- Visual mode is used for highlighting and selecting text
- There are three types of visual modes: visual, visual line, and visual blocks

## Insert Mode
- You already know what insert mode provides the same functionality as

## Ex mode
- Many novices complain about it because they enter it by accident and it throws them off
- I don't really use it (I just learned how to enter it purposefully last night) (`q:`)
- Useful for seeing and reexecuting command history (???)
