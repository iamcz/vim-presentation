# Overview:

- vim was written by Bram Molenaar and released in 1991
- vim is a open source clone of the UNIX editor VI
- A 2016 survey shows that vim is the 4th most popular editor (26.1% usage among developers trailing
  Notepad++, Visual Studio, and Sublime Text)
- The initial draw to vim (at least for me) was that you can do a lot without ever having to leave
  the home row -- although you might have to do a couple of hacks)
